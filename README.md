## *Basic Math*
basic_math.py is a simple python program that asks for a number,<br/>
then performs a set of simple mathematical calulations with said number.

## *Usage*
When the python program is executed, first the user will be prompted to input a number:<br/>
<br/>
*"What number do you want to use?" **3***<br/>
<br/>
The program then prints the chosen number, that number squared, and that number cubed.<br/>
<br/>
*The number you chose was: **3**<br/>
**3** squared is: **9**<br/>
**3** cubed is: **27***

## *Basic Math Reloaded*
Basic math reloaded adds functionality for trigonometric functions.


## *Contributing*
Please add additional functions performing different mathematical calculations of the inputed number.<br/>
Pull requests are welcome.
